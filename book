Uh this is it.
I've been thinking about the world recently.
"Think" is probably a bad word for it.
I thought about it.
I still am but everything is different now.
My point of view shifted into a state of mind.
The view of being yourself.
Yourself is a big word.
The self I am is not the same as the self I ever was.
My mind is not a constant collection.
My mind is not a dead thing.
It's living and it's moving.
Developing into something far greater.
Something that is great but never utilized.
Like a unused blade that is waiting to be sharpened again.
Hoping to get useful.
To be of much use.
But when all goals are reached...
Disappoinment.
The happy sharp blade.
Sad.
He has wishes.
All wishes the knife can't accomplish alone.
Wishes the blade never wished to have.
But here I am.
With goals.
With dreams.
And an end?
No.
That can't be true.
The blade is sad afterwards but he can change the world alone.
He can give up his goals.
The goals holding him back.
And reach for greater dreams.
Dreams and goals that he can achieve.
Many things but one is special to him.
To be of much use.
No.
That was his special goal but not anymore!
He has a new special goal now.
The knife is thinking but he can't think of anything.
He can't forget his initial dream to be of use.
Suddenly.
A thought came to his mind.
He thought to himself...
I can't change the world.
I can't help the world.
I can't be of much use for the world.
I am going to force the world.
So the knife went.
He went far.
To a place he doesn't recognize.
For the search of the dream.
His goal.
His reason to keep living.
He is searching.
Force the world.
Force a world.
Forcefully?
I doesn't seem right.
A vague goal.
A undefined dream.
Many tasks.
Too many to list.
A list without words.
The blade is falling in a trap.
He can't think.
So many things.
How?
Yes how?
His goal might be to figure out what his purpose in life is.
Little by little.
Task after task.
Task 1, 2, 3 and so on
The knife wasn't sure if he could pull that off.
So the blade settled on finding a single part of the goal.
A mini task!
The very first step of a bigger task.
And his dream containing those bigger takes.
It will take long sure.
It can be daunting.
But you need to start somewhere.
It is not difficult.
Just occasionally over the life I have left.
The blade is still thinking.
Very first step...
Taking over the world?
How?
The knife realized.
He is already completing his very first task.
Coming up with the very first task.
The blade was happy at first but misery struck when he realized it's a paradox.
I don't process the ability to form creative thoughts.
I am just a piece of metal.
I am just a piece of meat.
Just?
No that can't be true.
I can be more than that.
I will figure it out.
And I won't doubt myself.
